The Tsangpa Desi Karma Tenkyong Wangpo established a legal code in 1618, consisting of sixteen laws known as the 'Sixteen Laws' (ཞལ་ལྕེ་བཅུ་དྲུག་). These laws were based on the principles of Buddhism and the legal traditions of previous Tibetan rulers, with a focus on maintaining order and peace within Tibetan society.
The Sixteen Laws cover a wide range of offenses and disputes, including murder, theft, adultery, and broken contracts. The laws also address issues related to warfare, such as the treatment of prisoners of war and the consequences for cowardice in battle.
The legal code enacted by Karma Tenkyong Wangpo represents a significant development in the history of Tibetan law. It reflects a sophisticated understanding of legal principles and a commitment to upholding justice and fairness in Tibetan society.
The article draws several comparisons between Karma Tenkyong Wangpo's legal code and the earlier code enacted by Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen during the Phagmodrupa dynasty. Both codes are noted for their detail and comprehensiveness, reflecting a complex understanding of legal principles and a commitment to justice and fairness in Tibetan society. However, the article also highlights some key differences between the two codes.
One major difference is the scope of the codes. Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen's code, known as the Fifteen Laws (ཞལ་ལྕེ་བཅོ་ལྔ་), focuses primarily on criminal offenses and their corresponding punishments. In contrast, Karma Tenkyong Wangpo's Sixteen Laws cover a wider range of issues, including not only criminal offenses but also civil disputes and matters related to warfare and leadership.
Another difference is the emphasis on personal responsibility. Karma Tenkyong Wangpo's code places a greater emphasis on the importance of personal laws (རང་ཁྲིམས།), stressing the need for individuals to abide by moral and ethical principles for the well-being of society. This emphasis on personal responsibility is less prominent in Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen's code, which focuses more on the role of the state in enforcing laws and punishing offenders.

Finally, the two codes differ in their approach to punishment. Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen's code is generally more lenient, emphasizing the importance of rehabilitation and restorative justice. Karma Tenkyong Wangpo's code, on the other hand, takes a more punitive approach, advocating for the use of punishment to deter wrongdoing and maintain order.

Overall, the article suggests that while both legal codes represent important milestones in the development of Tibetan law, they also reflect different philosophies and approaches to justice. Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen's code emphasizes compassion and rehabilitation, while Karma Tenkyong Wangpo's code prioritizes order and personal responsibility.
