Shiratori, B. Ya. Vladimircov, P. Pelliot, L. Hambis, F. W. Cleaves, L. Krader, H. F. Schurmann, L. Ligeti and G. Doerfer, to mention only the authors of some of the most important contributions.2 Valuable, however, as these contributions are, we still lack a comprehensive historical survey which takes into account all the available sources, including evidence from coins. The present tentative review is an attempt towards comprehensiveness with regard to the use of qan and qa’an by the Mongols in the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, fixing as terminus ad quern the collapse of the Mongol Yuan dynasty in A.D. 1368. Unfortunately, space limits make it impossible for me to dwell on the sources as I would wish, and my choice of references and illustrations is, therefore, confined to the essentials. The turning point in our survey is the year 1229 in which Ogodei, the third son of Cinggis-qan, was elected to succeed his father as supreme ruler of the Mongol world-empire. Accordingly, we shall divide the survey in two parts: (A) the use of qan and qa’an before 1229, and (B) the use of qan and qa’an after 1229. A. Before 1229 1. Q a’an was not used as a title by the tribes of Mongolia or by Cinggis-qan. 2. Qan was used as: a) the title borne by the elected leaders of important tribes or peoples {ulus), such as the Mongqol, e.g. Qabul-qan, Qutula-qan, Ambaqai-qan; the * This is a revised version of my paper ‘The Use of Qcn and Q a ’an Amongst the Mongols, 12th- 14th Centuries’, read at the XXIV Meeting of the Permanent International Altaistic Conference (P.I.A.C.), Jerusalem, 17-22 August 1981.1 wish to express my sincere thanks to my friend Prof. Dr. Michael Weiers of Bonn for supplying the excellent photograph of Guyiig’s coin reproduced in this paper, and to Ing. Leonardo Piras of Rome for the careful tracing of Guyiig’s seal, also reproduced here. Qan, Q a ’an and the Seal of Giiyug 273 Kereyit, e.g. To’oril/Ong-qan; and the Naiman, e.g. Buyiruq-qan, Inanca-bilge-qan, Tayang-qan, Guciiliik-qan; b) the title borne by the leaders of tribal confederations, including Cinggis’ pan-Mongolian nation, hence Cinggis-qan, Jamuqa-qan; c) the title employed by the Mongols and, presumably, other tribes of Mongolia, for the rulers of other countries and the leaders of important tribes or tribal confederations outside Mongolia, e.g. Altan-qan of the Kitat, Burqan-qan of Qasin or Tang’ut, Arslan-qan of the Qarlu’ut, Qan Melik of the Qangli; d) a term (~ qa;3 pl. qat) designating the leader of a tribe or confederation, the ruler of a nation, and the powerful nature spirits in the Altaic shamanistic conception of the world. See the SH: tus qan, qa ergii-, qamuq-un qat, qajar usun-u ejet qat, etc.;4 e) a term (~ qa) meaning ‘qan-ship’, i.e. ‘rulership, government’, hence ‘pertaining to the government’, as in the expression qa bolqa- of SH §249 (where qa = ‘government property’). This meaning seems to be an extension of 2(d). After the death of Oinggis-qan in 1227, his sons inherited the vast Mongol empire and each of them became qan in his respective dominion {ulus). Since these dominions had been established before Cinggis’ death, the imperial princes were no doubt called qan already before 1227.5 In any event, the title of qan became unsuitable to designate the appointed successor to Oinggis’ throne also because this was a title traditionally associated with the leader of a tribe or tribal confederation. Mongol expansion and world rule called for the adoption of another, more exalted title. As the Mongol court was then largely under Uighur Turkish cultural influence, the title they adopted was the ancient Turk­ ish title of qayan {— Middle Mongolian qa'an), first assumed by Ogodei when he was elected emperor in 1229.6 B. After 1229 1. Qa'an was used as: a) the imperial title and personal epithet of Ogodei - the first ruler to use this title - who, as a result, was thereafter usually referred to simply as ‘(the) Q a’an’, i.e. ‘the qa'an par excellence';7 b) the title borne by all subsequent emperors of the Oinggiside line, even when their authority as qa'an of the greater Mongol empire had become largely nominal, as was the case already under Qubilai (r. 1260-1294).8 274 Igor de Rachewiltz This title ceased to be used when the Mongols were overthrown and replaced by the Ming in 1368;9 c) The title retrospectively conferred on Cinggis-qan and his most illustrious ancestors, both direct and collateral (Qabul, Qutula, Ambaqai and Yisügei). I think this retrospective conferment took place early in the reign of Qubilai, perhaps in 1266 or thereabouts, but this point requires further investigation;10 d) the term for ‘emperor’, with reference to (b), as in the expression qayan-u jrly-iyar ‘by imperial edict’;11 e) a term (= qan) designating the ruler of a nation or people (‘king, sovereign’), also used as a title, mainly in Buddhist texts, e.g. Asugi (= Asoka) qa’a n '2 2. Qan was used as: a) the title borne by the imperial princes, sons of Cinggis, and their descen­ dants, such as the khans of the Golden Horde and the Il-Khans of Persia. Thus: Tolui-qan, Batu-qan, Hülegü-qan. The implication of this usage is that these rulers, although sovereign (qan) in their respective dominions (m/ws), were still subject to the supreme authority of the ^ l ’an/emperor;13 b) a term (= A,2[dJ) designating the ruler of a nation, and, specifically, the Mongol sovereign, this being the ruler of the Great Mongol Nation and the world, e.g. qan ergü- (SH § 269), yeke Mongyol ulus-un qan, dalai- yin qan (see below); c) a term (= A,2[e]) meaning ‘government’.14 With regard to the expressions yeke Mongyol ulus-un qan and dalai-yin qan quoted above (b), some comments are necessary. In the SH § 280, Ôgôdei is called dalai-yin qahan (read ^an),15 rendered into Chinese as hai-nei huang-ti ‘emperor of [all] within the sea[s]’. The same concept is expressed in lines 2 -4 of the legend of the famous seal of Güyüg:ye£e Mongyolulus-un dalai-in qanu jrly ‘Order of the ruler of the Great Mongol Nation and of [all within] the seas (= the whole world)’.16 My interpretation of these lines diverges from that of Pelliot (‘du khan océanique du peuple des grands Mongols, l’ordre’),17 and of Mostaert and Cleaves (‘Ordre du Dalai-in qan [m.à m.: “Souverain (de ce qui est à l’intérieur) des mers”] de l’empire des Grands Mongols’).18 In the first place, I understand the wordsye^e Mongyol ulus as meaning ‘the Great Mongol Nation’ and not, as the above-mentioned authors do, ‘the people of the Great Mongols’ or ‘the empire of the Great Mongols.’ I base myself chiefly on the corresponding Turkish expression in the preamble of the letter of Güyüg to Innocent IV on which the seal in question is affixed. In the preamble, as W. Plate I, cf. note 16 u Zit- •Plate II, cf. note 30 Plate III, cf. note 34 Qan, Q a ’an and the Seal of Güyüg 275 Kotwicz noted long ago,19 the corresponding expression is kiir uluy ulus ‘the whole Great Nation (= the Great [Mongol] Nation)’. 20 The expression yeke Mongyol ulus is to be compared to expressions like qamuy Mongyol ulus ‘the entire Mongol nation’, olon Mongyol ulus ‘the numerous Mongol people’, etc.21 The expression Mongyol ulus ‘the Mongol nation (or people)’, without the attribute yeke ‘great’, is of course well attested in the SH and other docu­ ments of the thirteenth-fourteenth centuries.22 Moreover, yeke ulus ‘the Great Nation’, i.e. the Mongol state or world-empire, is a well-known expression in later Mongolian political writings.23 While I do not for a moment wish to deny the existence of the expression yeke Mongyol ‘Great Mongols’, amply documented by Mostaert and Cleaves,2 4 1 do not share their view that in the present instance this expression constitutes ‘une locution adjective déterminant ulus'.2* The interpretation of Mostaert and Cleaves should also be reviewed in the light of the recent comments by N .C. Munk- uev and J.-Ph. Geley.26 Secondly, I take the two expressions in the genitive case, i.e. yeke Mongyol ulus-un and dalai-in, as both qualifying qanu (gen.), but independently of each other (‘of the ruler of the Great Mongol Nation and of the whole world’), whereas Mostaert and Cleaves understand ‘du Dalai-in qan (m.à m.: “Souverain [de ce qui est à l’intérieur] des mers”) de /’empire des Grands Mongols’.27 This use of the double genitive without the conjunction ba is fairly common in Middle and Preclassical Mongolian.28 Moreover, the expre­ ssion yeke Mongyol ulus-un qan ‘ruler of the Great Mongol Nation’ is well attested. It is found in the Sino-Mongolian inscription of 1362, where it occurs followed almost immediately by the expression delekei-yin ejen ‘lord of [all] the earth’, which matches our dalai-in qan.29 The corresponding text of the preamble in Turkish presents also the same double genitive construc­ tion of the Mongol text of the seal and must be interpreted in the same way as the latter, i.e. ‘ruler of the whole Great Nation (= the Great [Mongol] Nation) and of the whole world’ (kür uluy ulusnug taluïnug %an).i0 With regard to the term dalai (= Tu. talui), I cannot accept P.D. Buell’s interpretation of it as meaning here the qan’s ‘estate’.31 The special meaning of dalai as the ‘imperial patrimony’, which developed later in Central and Western Asia, is definitely excluded in my view because of the overwhelming evidence from Mongol, Persian and Chinese sources to the effect that in the expression dalai-in qan with which we are concerned, dalai can only mean ‘all that is found in the land within the sea(s)’, hence ‘the whole world’.32 This is confirmed also by the corresponding imperial titles in the Persian sources discussed by V. Minorsky 33 and on contemporary coins, such as pâd- sâh-i jahân ‘sovereign of the world’ and xan-i 'alam ‘ruler of the world’. The 276 Igor de Rachewiltz ruler in question, Güyüg, is designated in his coins with these titles, as well as with that of qä’än discussed earlier.34 From the above it appears, then, that a Mongol sovereign like Güyüg and Möngke bore the title of ‘emperor’ (qa’an) because he was the formally elected and consecrated successor of Cinggis, hence the legitimate inheritor of the highest dignity in the empire which, since Ögödei, pertained to the qa’an. He was, at the same time, designated as ‘ruler of the Great Mongol N ation’ (yeke Mongyol ulus-un qan) and ‘ruler of the world’ (dalai-yin qan), i.e. ruler of the Mongols (sensu lato) and of the world at large - the whole world belonging by divine right to the Great Mongol Nation.35 Thus, the term qan found in the legend of Güyüg’s seal is not the imperial title borne by Güyüg, which as we have seen was qa’an, but a term (see above, B 2[b]) occurring in, and an integral part of, the standard designations or appellations of all Mongol emperors. It follows, then, that from the point of view of the legend alone, the ‘seal of Güyüg’ could have been the one belonging to Ögödei or even to Cinggis-qan, and doubts concerning the origin of this seal have, indeed, been expressed by Kotwicz, although on different grounds.36 The above covers, I think, the main points. I should mention, however, that as with almost all Mongol institutions and practices, there is also a certain inconsistency in the actual usage of the terms qan and qa’an. This is particularly evident in the ’Phags-pa inscriptions, where ‘Jirjgis qan’ alternates with ‘Jiggis qa an’ (qan in Ligeti’s transcription).37 In the Sino-Mongolian inscriptions in Uighur-Mongol script studied by Cleaves we observe the same phenomenon.38 In my opinion, the reason for this inconsistency is that, in the case of Cinggis- qan, after he was retrospectively conferred the title qayan, both forms existed side by side. In written language and the administration, the Mongols relied heavily on people of different countries, background and culture, and had no means of effectively and strictly enforcing uniformity of style and usage, since most of the Mongol officials lacked competence in such matters. This largely accounts for our own misunderstanding of their practices, as exemplified in the case of qan and qa’an. The inconsistent use of these two terms in the SH has been mainly responsible for past incorrect analyses, such as that by L. Kräder. It is now well established that the text of the SH underwent editorial changes that were responsible, among other things, for the title of qan (as distinguished from the other meanings of the word) borne by members of the Mongol ruling clan being substituted with that of qa’an (~ qahan). However, lack of accuracy and consistency on the part of editors and copyists was responsible also for (1) cases where qan was retained where it should have been changed to qa’an,™ and (2) changing qan into qa’an in cases where the change was not warranted.40 Similar inconsistencies are also found in the Persian sources (where they may be Qan, Q a ’an and the Seal of Güyüg 277 attributable in some cases to copyists, in others to the sources used by the author), in Uighur documents of the Mongol period,4’ and elsewhere. The misinterpretation of the role of the word qan in the legend of Giiyiig’s seal has unfortunately further clouded the issue. Another problem related to qan and qa'an which deserves full re-examination is the influence of Chinese, Turkish and Nestorian political and religious elements in early Mongol statecraft, but the problem is too complex to be discussed here.42 1 The linguistic relationship between these tw o terms is still a m oot point and I shall not discuss it in the present paper. For an overview of the problem, see now G. Doerfer, Türkische und mongolische Elem ente im Neupersischen, III (Wiesbaden, 1967), no. 1161 (pp. 176-179). Paul Pelliot was going to deal with this question in his note on Marco P olo’s ‘Kaan’, but he unfortunately never did. See his N otes on Marco Polo, I (Paris, 1959), p. 302. The reading q a ’an which I use throughout the paper is the Middle Mongolian form of O ld Turkish ( > Precl. M ong.) qayan. It corresponds to Persian q à ’ân/xâqân. 2 K.

In § 244, qan is defined as the person whose function is ‘to hold the nation’ (ulus bari-). With regard to ‘the lords and rulers of land and rivers* (qajar usun-u ejet qat), cf. the later use of qan (Khalkha xan) as an honorific term for mountains: Xentei-xan, Delger-xan, Burin-xan, etc. 5 Joci and Ca’adai (Cayatai), Cinggis’ tw o eldest sons, are regularly called ‘Jöä-xän ’ and ‘Câyatây- xàn’ by Rasid al-Din. See Doerfer, op. cit., p. 151. Cf. John of Pian di Carpine’s ‘Tossuccan’ (= Joci-qan), and his statement that ‘Tossuc (= J o c i). . . etiam Chan appellabant.’ See A.

Frye, HJAS 12 (1949), 303. 6 According to Juvaini, when Ögödei was enthroned all the princes ‘named him Qa’an.’ See ‘Ala- ad-Din 'Ata-Malik Juvaini, The History o f the World-Conquer or, tr. by J. A. Boyle (Manches­ ter, 1958), p. 187. Cf. the same statement in Rasid al-Din’s parallel account. See Rashid al-Din Tabib, The Successors o f Genghis Khan, tr. by J. A. Boyle (New York and London, 1971), p. 31. 7 See P. Pelliot, Notes on Marco Polo, I, p. 302; Boyle in HJAS 19 (1956), 152. 8 Juvaini, and Rasid al-Din following him, always refer to Güyüg (r. 1246-1248) as Gûyûk-xân, i.e. Güyüg-qan, not Güyük-qâ’ân, no doubt because the legitimacy of his rule was questioned when, with Möngke (r. 1251-1259), the imperial dignity passed from the line of Ögödei to that of Tolui. However, Pelliot, loc. cit., was mistaken when he stated that Qubilai was the first Mongol ruler to take the title of qa ’an as a mere epithet. Like Ögödei, Güyüg too bore the title of qa’an during his short reign, as attested by the legend on his coins (‘Güyüg qâ’ân*). See M. Weiers, ‘Münzaufschriften auf Münzen mongolischer U-khane aus dem Iran, Part O ne’, The Canada-Mongolia Review 4, 1 (April 1978), 43. Weiers’ authority is E. Drouin’s article ‘Notice sur les monnaies mongoles faisant partie du recueil des documents de l’époque mon­ gole publié par le prince Roland Bonaparte*, in Journal Asiatique, IX Sér., 7 (Mai-Juin 1896), [486-544], p. 506. The coin in question is ‘un dirhem frappé en Géorgie par Davith V, en l’année 646*, i.e. in A .D . 1248. Coins issued during Güyüg’s short reign are extremely rare, and I failed to find the one described by Drouin in the Cabinet des Médailles of the Bibliothè­ que nationale in October 1981. (I wish to express here my thanks to Mme A. Nègre, Chargée des monnaies orientales, for her kind assistance in my research at the B. N.). However, Güyüg’s title of qa’an is confirmed by other documents in Latin in which Güyüg is actually designated as chaam (= qa’an). See Simon de Saint-Quentin, Histoire des Tartares, ed. by J. Richard (Paris, 1965), pp. 90, 92, 94; P. Pelliot, Les Mongols et la Papauté (rep. in one vol., Paris, 1923), p. 118ff. I shall return to this important point later. As for Möngke, called qa’an by the Persian authors and on his coins (see Weiers, loc. cit.), he is also designated as qayan in the Mongolian inscription on the monument in his honour erected in 1257 (i.e. two years before his death), and in the legend of the seal that he bestowed on the Nestorian Patriarchate. See N . Poppe in CAJ 6 (1951), 17-18; J. R. Hamilton in Journal Asiatique 260 (1972), 160. 9 See Pelliot, Notes on Marco Polo, II (Paris, 1963), p. 657. In Iran the name and title of the q a ’an ruling in China disappears from coinage after Qubilai’s death and the conversion of the Il-Khans to Islam (1295); and in the Persian tributary documents of the early Ming even the Chinese emperor is addressed as xân. See B. Spuler in The Encyclopaedia o f Islam, N ew Ed., Ill (Leiden-London, 1971), p. 1121 b; Schurmann, op. cit., p. 315, n. 11. 10 The date for the beginning of this practice is uncertain, but it must be placed between 1260 and 1271, as the title qa’an is not used for Cinggis by Juvaini, but it occurs already in Grigor of Akner’s History o f the Nations of the Archers. See F. W. Cleaves in HJAS 12 (1949), 418-419. Thereafter, the title appears in Sino-Mongolian inscriptions in Uighur-Mongol script, in the ’Phags-pa inscriptions - albeit irregularly (see below) - in the SH (see also below), and in the later Mongol sources, such as the seventeenth century chronicles and inscriptions. Rasid al- Din, like Juvaini, uses xân throughout for Cinggis, but both xân and qâ’ân for his ancestors. A comparison of all the MSS of his work is, however, necessary to throw light on the peculiarity of his usage of qâ ’ân. See, provisionally, Doerfer, op. cit., pp. 150-153. Since posthumous titles were conferred on Cinggis’ father Yisügei (or Yesügei) in 1266, it is possible that the extension of the title qa ’an to Cinggis originated about that time.

These are: 1) the filling in of the damaged areas of the border of the seal, and 2) the addition of the small circle at the end of line 6.

See A. Mostaert et F.W. Cleaves, op. cit., pp. 450-451. 29 See F.W. Cleaves in HJAS 12 (1949), 62(3] and 83(3]. Cf. also ibid. 14 (1951), 66b, and 15 (1952), 78a. Cf. also the expression talayiyin èjen ulusun qaan in the *Phags-pa text of the Chii-yung kuan inscriptions, rendered by Pelliot as ‘master of the ocean, Emperor of the Nation’ (Notes on Marco Polo, I, p. 301; cf. Les Mongols et la Papauté, p. 121, n. 3). Cf. Poppe, The Mongolian Monuments, p. 63(9), 64(9), 66. 30 For the text and transcription of the preamble, see Pl. II, and Pelliot, op. cit., pp. 15, 22. Pelliot’s rendering (ibid., pp. 16, 22) ‘[nous] le khan océanique du grand peuple tout entier’ is not correct. Equally faulty, therefore, are those citations or translations of the preamble by authors (like G. Soranzo, A. Van den Wyngaert, F. Risch, E. Voegelin, N .P . Sastina, B. Spuler, J. A. Boyle, J.J. Saunders, etc.) who followed Pelliot’s interpretation. A notable exception is Doerfer (op. cit., no. 1672, p. 634), who rendered it as follows: ‘Chan des machtvollen großen (Mongolen-)Staates und des Weltkreises’. Cf. also his remark (loc. cit.) that ‘das ist in etwa eine Übersetzung des mo. Siegels.’ 31 Buell’s translation of the words yeke Mongyol ulus-un dalai-in qan is ‘qan of the dalay of the Great Mongol Patrimony’. See his Tribe, Qan and Ulus in Early Mongol China: Some Pro­ legomena to Yuan History, Ph. D. Dissertation, University of Washington, 1977 (Univ. Microfilms International, Ann Arbor, 1981), p. 250, n. 129. This is untenable also on the ground that in such a rendering both datai and ulus are taken as meaning the qan’s ‘patrimony’ or ‘estate’; see ibid., p. 36, where yeke dalai is rendered as ‘great estate’. Therefore, according to Buell’s translation, the actual meaning of the above-mentioned sentence would be ‘qan of the estate of the Great Mongol Patrimony’. 32 See Mostaert et Cleaves, op. cit., pp. 491-492; Pelliot, op. cit., pp. 23-24, and Notes on Marco Polo, I, pp. 301-302; V. Minorsky’s remarks in W. Barthold, Turkestan Down to the Mongol Invasion, 4th ed. (London, 1977), p. 516, n. 225; Poppe, The Mongolian Monuments, pp. 66 (3rd para.), 110, n. 113; H .F. Schumann in HJAS 19 (1956), 330; and Doerfer, op. cit., 1 (Wiesbaden, 1963), no. 196. 33 In Iranica. Twenty Articles, University of Teheran, Vol. 775 (1964), p. 65. 34 See above, n. 8. As 1 explained there, a reproduction of the coin bearing the legend 'Gûyüg qa ’an’ is not available to me at present; however, thanks to Prof. Weiers of Bonn I have obtained a photograph, reproduced in Pl. Ill, of Güyüg’s coin from Sayyid Jamâl Turâbi TabâfabâTs catalogue of Mongol coins from Iran (see Weiers, op. cit., p. 42, n. 2). The full text of the legend is: 1 Guyuk 2 padisah[-i] 3 Jahân xän[-i] 4 ’¿lam. See ibid., p. 43. For pâd(i)sâh = qan, see Schumann, op. cit., p. 315, n. 11, and Ligeti in Acta Orientalia Hung. 14 (1962), 40, n. 57. As is known, neither John of Pian di Carpine nor William of Rubruck distinguishes between qan and qa'an, and in their reports they use chan (~ kan, can, cham) throughout, whereas Marco Polo seems to make a distinction between the two. See Pelliot, Notes on Marco Polo, I, p. 302. In the case of Pian di Carpine and Rubruck, their 'chan' obviously corresponds to both qan and qân (= qa'an)-, however, this problem deserves further study. 35 On the Mongol ‘doctrine’ of world-domination, see I. de Rachewiltz in Papers on Far Eastern History 7 (March 1973), 21-36. 36 See Kotwicz, op. cit., p. 278, n. 1. 37 See L.

Qan, Qa'an and the Seal of Güyüg 281 38 Cf. the inscription of 1362 in HJAS 12 (1949), 71 a: ‘Cinggis qayan’, and that of 1346, ibid., 15 (1952), 73 a: ‘Cinggis qan’. 39 E.g., Qabul-qan in §§ 139, 140; Cinggis-qan in § 255. 40 E.g., Ong-qahan in § 150; Altan-qa’an in §§250,251.
